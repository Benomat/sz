.sz file handler

very self explanitory.

download the .py or the .exe from releases, put it into a folder and run it.


example .sz code:
```
0 tst 0
1 jmp 3
2 jmp 6
3 dec 0
4 inc 1
5 jmp 0
6 end
```
or
```
tst 0
jmp 3
jmp 6
dec 0
inc 1
jmp 0
end
```
(line numbering still starts at 0)


you can also alternatively use hlt instead of end
